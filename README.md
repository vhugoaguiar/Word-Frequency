## Overview

Welcome to the Word Frequency Counter, a beginner-level web development project aimed at calculating the frequency of words in a block of text. This project allows users to input text, analyze word frequency, and display the results in a tabular format, ordered in descending sequence by word frequency. The project demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and basic UI development.

## Project Description
